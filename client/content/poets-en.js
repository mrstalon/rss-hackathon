              'For nearly ten years, the poet\'s works were totally banned. Only in 1963, her post-improsonment poems were published in Belarusian magazines for the first time. Thanks to the then Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the BSSR, Maksim Tank, Larysa Hienijuš\'s first in Belarus collection of works, «Невадам зь Нёмана» was published in 1967. It was edited by Uladzimir Karatkievič pro bono. It included most of the poems from «Ад родных ніў» without some excerpts removed by censors, as well as new poems of the Zelva period. Then, for years she was allowed to publish only children’s poetry.\nLarysa Hienijuš died in 1983. Thousands of people came to her burial.\nIn 1999, the Belarusian Helsinki Committee appealed to the General Prosecutor\'s Office to annul an unjust sentence against both Hienijušs. The Office forwarded the appeal to the Supreme Court which refused the annulment as the poet "has no grounds for rehabilitation." However, the reasons for refusal were unknown as, according to the Court\'s letter, "they may only be given to the repressed person".'
